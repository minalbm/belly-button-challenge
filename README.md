# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge I have created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

You can access to my dashboard using the following URL: https://minalbm.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

This repository also includes the dataset, the JavaScript code, as well as the HTML code.
